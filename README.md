All work from the Austin Coding Academy bootcamp

## TODO
- Learn some advanced git management
- rebase all course sections to reflect branches that equate to the section itself
  - all of 311 should be on one branch
- sqash all commits **not** done by myself to themselves
  - all dependabot commits should squash together
  - all teacher commits should squash together
